Leaf Concepts have three primary fields for describing information about them: ( Concept fields referenced here are stored in the app.Concept database table unless otherwise noted ) Name - The primary text shown for the Concept within the tree. Try to keep this brief, leveraging parent Concepts above it to provide context and provenance where possible. This is stored in the database as UiDisplayName . Subtext - The smaller, lighter text shown to the right of the Name . This is optional, and we have found this works well for adding information such as how far back data in the Concept go. This is stored in the database as UiDisplaySubtext . Full Text - The text shown when a user drags the Concept over to create a query. We suggest making this a bit more verbose than Name , and approximating a sentence. This is stored in the database as UiDisplayText . Tooltips \u00b6 Tooltips are a bit of a misnomer, as they are actually shown when the user clicks Learn More while hovering over a Concept, rather than just by hovering alone. Tooltip text can be used to provide detailed information to users about the data the Concept represents, but may be too long to put in the Name or Subtext . The text can be seen in the above example in the Sources: Epic Clarity... information. This is stored in the database as UiDisplayTooltip . Patient Count \u00b6 The Patient Count field shows a small green person indicating the number of unique patients the user would expect to find if she were to run a query with this Concept only and with no date restrictions, etc. An example stored procedure to automatically loop through the app.Concept table and calculate this for each Concept is here https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/obj/app.sp_CalculatePatientCounts.StoredProcedure.sql , though please note that this will likely be scripted into an API or CLI-based procedure in the future. This can be used by: EXEC app . sp_CalculatePatientCounts @ PersonIdField = 'person_id' -- PersonId field for this Leaf instance , @ TargetDataBaseName = 'ClinDb' -- Clinical database to query for this Leaf instance , @ TotalAllowedRuntimeInMinutes = 180 , -- Total minutes to allow to entire process to run , @ PerRootConceptAllowedRuntimeInMinutes -- Total minutes to allow a given Root Concept -- and children to run, , @ SpecificRootConcept = NULL -- Optional, specify a Root ConceptId to only -- recalculate counts for part of the tree This is stored in the database as UiDisplayPatientCount . Numeric Filters \u00b6 Use numeric filters to allow users to query based on a numeric value in your database. Create a new Concept and set Configuration -> Is Numeric to true . Set the Name and Full Text fields in General Display as you normally would. Fill in the Numeric default text , which is shown after the Name if the user has not filtered the Concept by any numeric value. Optionally, set the Units of measurement , such as years , kg , etc. Under SQL , set the Numeric Field or expression to the numeric column or expression that you'd like to query. Adding Dropdowns \u00b6 Dropdowns (also known as Concept specializations ) allow users to optionally specify additional logic about a Concept to include in a query. For example, imagine we have a dbo.diagnosis table that looks like this: person_id encounter_id diag_date coding_sys diag_code source type A 123 2009-01-01 ICD10 E11.2 billing primary B 456 2005-08-10 ICD10 T02.5 radiology secondary B 789 2011-06-22 ICD10 A15.5 charges primary We would probably create a Concept tree with a root Diagnoses Concept using the ICD10 hierarchy to allow users to run queries to find patients with certain diagnosis codes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Problem 1 \u00b6 What if users wanted to specify that the diagnosis must come from a specific source, such as billing or radiology ? One approach to solve this would be to create child Concepts under every diagnosis Concept, with each child representing a diagnosis from a particular source: This works to a certain extent, though with every additional diagnosis source, we've doubled the number of diagnosis Concepts. Given that there are roughly 68,000 ICD-10 diagnosis codes as of this writing (not including their parent Concepts which represent ranges of codes), adding child Concepts for just the three example sources above, billing , radiology , and charges will add over 200,000 Concepts to our tree. Just as importantly, this solution may not necessarily be intuitive for users. Problem 2 \u00b6 What if we then wanted to also allow users to specify whether the diagnosis was primary or secondary ? We could simply add these as additional child Concepts, though users wouldn't be able to find patients who had this as the primary diagnosis and from billing . Alternatively, we could create primary and secondary child Concepts under every billing , radiology , and charges Concept: Yikes. This creates a Cartesian product of all diagnosis sources and primary/secondary types for every diagnosis Concept . This is likely to be both confusing for users and wasteful in visual space (in the UI) and database storage. Dropdowns to the Rescue \u00b6 Dropdowns allow users to make the Concept logic more granular if they choose to, and do so in a visually intuitive way. Creating Dropdowns \u00b6 Go to the Admin tab and click on any Concept. Under SQL , click Table, View, or Subquery -> Manage SQL Sets . Under the SQL Set you'd like to add a dropdown to, click +Add New Dropdown in the lower-left. Under Default Text , add the text that should be shown if the user hasn't selected a dropdown option. For each option you'd like to add, click +Add Dropdown Option and enter the Text that should be shown, as well as the SQL WHERE clause that should be appended to the Concept SQL if the user selects the option. Click Save at the top. Because dropdowns are tied to SQL Sets , every Concept that uses that SQL Set is able to enable the dropdown as well, allowing dropdowns to be easily reused across many Concepts. Enabling Dropdowns for a Concept \u00b6 After creating the dropdowns, in the Admin screen click the Concept you'd like to enable dropdowns for. Under Configuration , make sure Allow Dropdowns is set to true . Under Dropdowns , click each dropdown you'd like to enable. Enabled dropdowns will turn green and say \"enabled!\". If you don't see any dropdowns available, under SQL make sure the Concept is using the same SQL Set as the dropdowns Click Save at the top. Users will now see the dropdown options when they drag over the Concept. Restricting Access \u00b6 Certain Concepts may represent sensitive data which you need to restrict access to, such as financial data. To restrict access to certain users or groups: In the Admin screen, create a new Concept or click an existing Concept to edit. Scroll down to Access Restrictions and click +Add New Restriction . Select whether you'd like to give a specific User access or a Group . Enter the User or Group name, making sure to include the Leaf Issuer after the user name. Note that: All child and descendent Concepts beneath the restricted Concept inherit the restriction. If there are multiple restrictions, users need to meet only one of them in order to access the Concept. Admins can always see all Concepts, whether restricted or not. Universal IDs \u00b6 Universal IDs allow users to query multiple Leaf instances in a federated fashion (see Networking Multiple Leaf instances to learn how this works). Federated queries work by mapping the requesting user's local Concepts to the federated node's Concepts by UniversalID . UniversalIDs are defined using the URN Syntax . If you are only planning to query Concepts locally at your institution, you don't need to worry about setting UniversalIDs Mapping UniversalIds at Query Execution \u00b6 Assuming multiple Leaf instances have exchanged certificates, user queries can be federated if: Every Concept involved in the user's query has a UniversalId , and All federated Leaf instances have Concepts that match the UniversalIds used in the query. Because UniversalIds themselves are data-model agnostic and are simply a pointer to an arbitrary Concept, this functionality works even if federated Leaf instances use different data models. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuKKC7B8mHI for a working demonstration Naming Conventions \u00b6 A Concept representing Outpatient encounters could be defined with the UniversalId : urn:leaf:concept:encounter:type=outpatient Or a Concept representing diagnosis codes for hypertension in pregnancy in ICD-10 could be: urn:leaf:concept:diagnosis:coding=icd10+code=O13.9 Note that these are simply examples, and you are free to define UniversalIds as you'd like. Perhaps the most important point though is to be sure that the UniversalId naming conventions for your Leaf instance and any other Leaf instances match exactly. You can find UniversalIds in the Admin panel under Identifiers -> UniversalId . You don't need to preface UniversalIds with \"urn:leaf:concept:\" yourself, as Leaf will handle that for you. Univeral IDs in dropdowns \u00b6 Note that dropdown options also use UniversalIds using the naming convention \"urn:leaf:specialization:\". If you are federating queries across multiple instances, make sure dropdowns similarly have UniversalIds defined . Concepts without Universal IDs \u00b6 There are inevitably scenarios where although you are federating your queries with other institutions, you still want to expose certain Concepts to your users that are unique to your local database and not expected to be found elsewhere. Good news: That's okay! Leaf expects that not all clinical databases will be identical, and you shouldn't need to hide Concepts from your users simply because other institutions don't have the same data. If a user uses one or more Concepts that are \"local only\" and don't have UniversalIds , Leaf will let them know which institutions weren't able to run the query. Creating Concepts by SQL Scripts \u00b6 Certain Concepts are inherantly hierarchical or voluminous enough that it makes more sense to programmatically add them, such as diagnosis or procedure codes. Head over to the Leaf Scripts repo at https://github.com/uwrit/leaf-scripts to see examples of how to do this.","title":"Concept Reference"},{"location":"administration/concept_reference/#concept-reference","text":"","title":"Concept Reference"},{"location":"administration/concept_reference/#name-subtext-and-full-text","text":"Textual descriptions of Concepts are critical to making information about them clear to users.

While it is designed to be fun and intuitive for users, ultimately Leaf's most important job is to reliably and flexibly construct SQL queries using a few simple but powerful configuration rules. Let's start with an example. We'll use an OMOP v5 database for this example, though these steps can be applied to any particular data model. We'll focus on using the person and visit_occurrence tables via views in our OMOP database. The goals are: Configure the Leaf SQL compiler. Create Leaf SQL Sets for the v_person and v_visit_occurrence views. Create basic demographics and encounter Concepts which query our clinical database. Configuring the SQL compiler \u00b6 Every Leaf instance assumes that there is a single, consistent field that represents patient identifiers. In OMOP databases this is the person_id field, which can be found on nearly any table with patient data. Likewise, Leaf assumes that longitudinal tables in the database will have a consistent field representing encounter identifiers. In OMOP this is the visit_occurrence_id field. Before starting, let's create two SQL views called v_person and v_visit_occurrence to make the person and visit_occurrence tables simpler to query. This example is specific to OMOP but the approach works for other models as well. Note that pointing Leaf at views is completely optional and demonstrated here for convenience and illustrative purposes. Our v_person view is defined as: CREATE VIEW dbo . v_person AS SELECT p . person_id , p . birth_datetime , gender = c_gender . concept_code , race = c_race . concept_name , ethnicity = c_ethnicity . concept_name , location_state = loc . state FROM dbo . person AS p LEFT JOIN dbo . concept AS c_gender ON p . gender_concept_id = c_gender . concept_id LEFT JOIN dbo . concept AS c_race ON p . race_concept_id = c_race . concept_id LEFT JOIN dbo . concept AS c_ethnicity ON p . ethnicity_concept_id = c_ethnicity . concept_id LEFT JOIN dbo . location AS loc ON p . location_id = loc . location_id person_id birth_datetime gender race ethnicity location_state A 1990-1-1 F Black or African American Not Hispanic or Latino NY B 1945-2-2 M Asian or Pacific Islander Not Hispanic or Latino OR The v_visit_occurrence view is defined as: CREATE VIEW dbo . v_visit_occurrence AS SELECT o . person_id , o . visit_occurrence_id , o . visit_start_date , o . visit_end_date , o . care_site_id , visit_type_code = c_visit . concept_code FROM dbo . visit_occurrence AS o LEFT JOIN dbo . concept AS c_visit ON o . visit_concept_id = c_visit . concept_id person_id visit_occurrence_id visit_start_date visit_end_date care_site_id visit_type_code A 123 2011-01-01 2011-01-01 site1 OP A 456 2015-05-28 2015-06-07 site1 IP B 789 2014-09-01 2014-09-01 site2 ED Pretty straightforward so far. After creating the views in the database, let's start by configuring Leaf's SQL compiler, which is stored in your compiled API under /leafapi/api/appsettings.json : Let's break it down: Alias acts as a indicator to Leaf to insert an alias in a SQL statement wherever this character(s) is found (more on that in a bit). We'll set this to @ for simplicity and readability, and because it is commonly used in many Leaf configurations. FieldPersonId is the name of the SQL field that appears in all tables or views we'd like to query and represents unique identifiers for patients. The field person_id contains identifiers for patients and appears in all tables which link to a patient, so we'll choose that. FieldEncounterId is the name of the field that represents visit identifiers, so we'll use visit_occurrence_id . Great - we've now provided the most important information to help Leaf understand the basic structure of our clinical database. Note that these values are expected to be consistent and configured only once. Also, if you change them, make sure you restart the Leaf API in order for the changes to take effect. Next, we'll move on to creating Concepts, the building blocks of Leaf queries. Creating SQL Sets \u00b6 We want to allow users to query Concepts using our two new views, v_person and v_visit_occurrence . To do so, let's create a Leaf SQL Set for each. Open up the Leaf client in your web browser. Click Admin -> Concepts on the left sidebar. If you don't see the Admin tab, make sure you have configured your admin group correctly Click Start by creating a Concept SQL Set . SQL Sets are the SQL tables, views, or subqueries that are the foundation of Concepts and provide their FROM clauses. You should see a single white box near the top. Under SQL FROM , enter dbo.v_person . Next, create another SQL Set . Click + Create New SQL Set and fill in dbo.v_visit_occurrence under SQL FROM . Also, check the Has Encounters box. This indicates that Leaf should expect to find an Encounter identifier and date fields on this table. Under Date Field , fill in @.visit_start_date , which you'll recall is the first date field on the v_visit_occurrence view. Don't forget to prepend the alias placeholder @. before the field name. Click Save at the top. Now we are ready to make a few Concepts that use our v_person and v_visit_occurrence views. Creating Concepts \u00b6 We've successfully created SQL Sets for our views, so we can now create Concepts that users can interact with. Our next goal will be to create a basic Concept tree with the following structure: Demographics \u251c\u2500\u2500 Gender \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Female \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Male Encounters \u251c\u2500\u2500 Inpatient \u251c\u2500\u2500 Outpatient Go to Admin -> Concepts , then click +Create New Concept . Demographics \u00b6 Under Name , fill in \"Demographics\". This will be the text that users see in the Concept tree. Go down to Full Text and enter \"Have demographics\". Users will see this text if dragged over to create a query. Why is Full Text different than Name ? The intent here is to make the query as descriptive as possible in something approximating an English sentence. Lastly, under the SQL section make sure the Table, View, or Subquery box shows dbo.v_person and the WHERE Clause field is empty. Click Save at the top. As you may have noticed, this Concept is intended to simply serve as a hierachical container for Concepts under it related to Demographics. By itself it will likely not be very useful to users, and if they were to drag it over the query would be something simple like SELECT person_id FROM dbo.v_person , in other words, all patients in the table. Next let's create the Gender Concept, which will appear under Demographics . Click +Create New Concept at the top. Gender \u00b6 Under Name , fill in \"Gender\", and under Full Text , fill in \"Identify with a gender\". We want this Concept to appear beneath Demographics , so drag the new Concept into it in order set Demographics as the parent Concept. Finally, as this Concept represents data about patient gender, users presumably would expect that patients without this data should be excluded. Under SQL -> WHERE Clause enter @.gender IS NOT NULL . Click Save . Repeat the process for the final two demographic Concepts, Female and Male , with the following data: Female General Display Name : \"Female\" Full text : \"Identify as female\" SQL Table, View, or Subquery : \"dbo.v_person\" WHERE Clause : \"@.gender = 'F'\" Male General Display Name : \"Male\" Full text : \"Identify as male\" SQL Table, View, or Subquery : \"dbo.v_person\" WHERE Clause : \"@.gender = 'M'\" In reality people don't necessarily identify with gender binaries of female or male, and clinical databases will often reflect this. Female and male here are used simply for demonstrative purposes Road test \u00b6 Before proceeding to create our Encounters Concepts, let's take a moment to confirm our Demographics Concepts are working as expected by running a quick query to see how many female patients are in our database. Click the Find Patients tab in the upper-left and drag Female over to the first panel. Click Run Query . If you see a count of patients (assuming your database has female patients), great! You can even click (i) -> show detail -> SQL to see the query Leaf created using the new Concept. Success! If your query didn't work (you'll get a modal window notifying you there was an error), check the Leaf logs to see if there were any syntax or other errors in the query Encounters \u00b6 Now that you're hopefully getting the hang of creating Concepts, let's finish by creating Encounters Concepts so users can query information by encounter types. Remember that the structure should look like this: Encounters \u251c\u2500\u2500 Inpatient \u251c\u2500\u2500 Outpatient The field-level information for each Concept is (making sure to nest Inpatient and Outpatient under Encounters ): Encounters General Display Name : \"Encounters\" Full text : \"Had an encounter\" SQL Table, View, or Subquery : \"dbo.v_visit_occurrence\" WHERE Clause : Inpatient General Display Name : \"Inpatient\" Full text : \"Were admitted as an inpatient\" SQL Table, View, or Subquery : \"dbo.v_visit_occurrence\" WHERE Clause : \"@.visit_type_code = 'IP'\" Outpatient General Display Name : \"Outpatient\" Full text : \"Had an outpatient visit\" SQL Table, View, or Subquery : \"dbo.v_visit_occurrence\" WHERE Clause : \"@.visit_type_code = 'OP'\" And that's it! Making Concepts Searchable \u00b6 So you've been able to make Concepts that users can query - great! Over time you'll likely find that your Concept tree will grow as you find new use cases and data sources, and may become cumbersome for users to manually traverse. Leaf's Concept search is a powerful feature which will automatically parse and tokenize the text in your Concepts. This allows users to search for Concepts of interest to them in any word order. To enable this feature, run the app.sp_UpdateSearchIndexTables stored procedure. Leaf search works by using a relatively simple inverted index and forward index search engine in pure SQL. In SQL Server: EXEC app . sp_UpdateSearchIndexTables Warning Be sure to run this stored procedure after any edits or additions to your Concept tree to ensure that users can search the latest text for your Concepts Final thoughts \u00b6 If you were able to successfully make the Concepts in this tutorial, congratulations! Hopefully this was helpful and intuitive enough for you to get started making your clinical database accessible and intuitive for your users as well. Concepts can be extremely flexible and we've only scratched the surface of their functionality.

Extract data for those patients. After users identify a Cohort in (1), they can next do (2), which we'll explain here. In Leaf, extracted data for a cohort are called \"datasets\", which is short-hand for Patient List Datasets . This refers to the row-level patient data you can see on the Patient List screen. Datasets can based on either: SQL statements which output dynamic columns unique to your data. Or, SQL statements which output templated columns representating of FHIR resources . We recommend using templated FHIR Datasets (2) only if you are federating your Leaf instance with other institutions , as FHIR templates allow Leaf instances to all return predictable row-level data. In all other cases, we recommend using dynamic datasets (1), as they offer flexible, easy configurability . Basic Demographics \u00b6 The core dataset Leaf uses is Basic Demographics . The output of this query is used to both populate the initial Patient List screen, as well as populate the bar charts on the Visualize screen. The fields in Basic Demographics represent a denormalized combination of the FHIR Person and Patient resources. The expected columns are: Name Type personId nvarchar addressPostalCode nvarchar addressState nvarchar birthDate datetime deceasedDateTime datetime ethnicity nvarchar gender nvarchar deceasedBoolean bit hispanicBoolean bit marriedBoolean bit language nvarchar maritalStatus nvarchar mrn nvarchar name nvarchar race nvarchar religion nvarchar Key Points \u00b6 All columns in Basic Demongraphics are required Leaf will automatically date-shift, calculate ages, and remove the HIPAA identified columns ( mrn and name ) depending on if the user is in Identified or De-identified mode The Patient Identifier column must be called personId While Leaf Concepts are flexible regarding the column name for patient identifiers, Datasets are more restrictive and require a predictable, specific column name. This ensures alignment of Leaf Datasets when multiple Leaf instances are federated, among other reasons It's OK if you don't have data for every column Though every column must be returned in the SQL statement, it's fine to hard-code it as NULL or 'Unknown' , etc. For example, religion = NULL The isDeceased , isHispanic , and isMarried bit/boolean columns are used in the bar charts on the Visualize screen These are needed because Leaf does not enforce specific values for the ethnicity or maritalStatus columns (so you have flexiblity in showing your data as it is), but in return you need to define these true/false columns yourself. For example, hispanicBoolean = CAST(CASE ethnicity WHEN 'Hispanic or Latino' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS BIT) Values in gender must be F , Female , M , or Male This allows them to be predictably aggregated in bar charts (case insensitive) Defining the Basic Demographics Query \u00b6 Basic Demographics and other datasets can be added using the Admin page within Leaf. Define a query in SQL that returns the columns defined above. Make sure each column returns the expected type as well. In Leaf, go to Admin -> Datasets . If you haven't created a Basic Demographics dataset yet, Leaf will suggest you create one. Click to do so. Copy/paste or type out your SQL statement. Make sure the green arrows on the left light up to confirm you're returning all expected columns. Info You don't need to do anything special to find a particular cohort of patients; just make a plain SQL statement to find any cohort. Leaf will automatically wrap your SQL in a Common Table Expression and filter it to relevant patients for you. Using OMOP? Try this Basic Demographics SQL query as a starting point: SELECT personId = CONVERT ( NVARCHAR ( 10 ), P . person_id ) , addressPostalCode = L . zip , addressState = L .[ state ] , birthDate = P . birth_datetime , deceasedDateTime = D . death_datetime , ethnicity = c_ethnicity . concept_name , gender = c_gender . concept_name , deceasedBoolean = CONVERT ( BIT , CASE WHEN D . person_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) , hispanicBoolean = CONVERT ( BIT , CASE WHEN c_ethnicity . concept_name = 'Hispanic or Latino' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) , marriedBoolean = CONVERT ( BIT , 0 ) /* Assumed not available */ , language = CONVERT ( NVARCHAR ( 1 ), NULL ) /* Assumed not available */ , maritalStatus = CONVERT ( NVARCHAR ( 1 ), NULL ) /* Assumed not available */ , mrn = CONVERT ( NVARCHAR ( 1 ), NULL ) /* Assumed not available */ , name = CONVERT ( NVARCHAR ( 1 ), NULL ) /* Assumed not available */ , religion = CONVERT ( NVARCHAR ( 1 ), NULL ) /* Assumed not available */ , race = c_race . concept_name FROM dbo . person AS P LEFT JOIN dbo . concept AS c_gender ON P . gender_concept_id = c_gender . concept_id LEFT JOIN dbo . concept AS c_race ON P . race_concept_id = c_race . concept_id LEFT JOIN dbo . concept AS c_ethnicity ON p . ethnicity_concept_id = c_ethnicity . concept_id LEFT JOIN dbo .[ location ] AS L ON P . location_id = L . location_id LEFT JOIN dbo . death AS D ON P . person_id = D . person_id Adding New Datasets \u00b6 If you've successfully added the Basic Demographics dataset and can see data returned in the Patient List screen in the Leaf user interface, you're off to a great start. Inevitably though you'll likely want to allow users to add more datasets beyond demographics. Let's start with an example. In this case, we'll add a Platelet dataset which will represent platelet count laboratory tests. Determine the Template and Query \u00b6 First, we need to decide whether we're using a Dataset template or dynamic query. For templates, in FHIR labs are generally represented as Observations . However as we recommend using Dynamic datasets unless federating with other Leaf instances , we'll use a dynamic dataset here here. For demonstrative purposes we'll use data from the MIMIC Critical Care Database , but the methods here can be applied to other data models as well. Let's suppose we have a SQL table or view representing labs (including platelets) called dbo.v_LABEVENTS that looks like this in our SQL database: SUBJECT_ID HADM_ID LABEL LOINC_CODE CHARTIME VALUE VALUENUM VALUEUOM 1 100 Platelet Count 777-3 2101-10-04 301 301 K/uL 1 200 Platelet Count 777-3 2101-02-10 192 192 K/uL 2 300 Platelet Count 777-3 2101-12-22 533 533 K/uL Our SQL statement to pull this data in Leaf may therefore look like (changing the column names a bit to make the meaning more clear to users) SELECT personId = CAST ( SUBJECT_ID AS NVARCHAR ( 10 )) , encounterId = CAST ( HADM_ID AS NVARCHAR ( 10 )) , category = 'lab' , code = LOINC_CODE , effectiveDate = CHARTTIME , valueString = VALUE , valueQuantity = VALUENUM , valueUnit = VALUEUOM FROM [ dbo ].[ v_LABEVENTS ] WHERE LABEL = 'Platelet Count' Which would output: personId encounterId category code effectiveDate valueString valueQuantity valueUnit 1 100 lab 777-3 2101-10-04 301 301 K/uL 1 200 lab 777-3 2101-02-10 192 192 K/uL 2 300 lab 777-3 2101-12-22 533 533 K/uL Insert the dataset \u00b6 Next, we'll add out dataset using the Admin -> Datasets screen. As we did with Basic Demographics, we'll first define a query in SQL that returns the columns defined above. In Leaf, go to Admin -> Datasets . Click create a new one on the right to add a Dataset . Set the Name as \"Platelet Count\". Create a new Category, \"Labs\", and use that as the Category. Set the Dataset Template as \"Dynamic\". Copy/paste or type out your SQL statement. Under Expected Columns , Leaf will do it's best to guess the types of your columns based on their names. Validate that the column types match those in the SQL database, and check Deidentify for any columns you'd like users not to view if in de-identified mode . Under Dynamic Properties , set the Date Column as \"effectiveDate\", String Value Column as \"valueString\", and Numeric Value Column as \"valueQuantity\". Leaf will use these columns when computing statistics and generating a sparkline for the Dataset . Test \u00b6 Finally, let's test to see if the dataset works. In the Leaf client app, run a query for a cohort which you know to have platelet lab values. In the Patient List , select the new dataset. If you run into errors, be sure to check the Leaf logs If you're able to navigate to the Patient List and add the new dataset, congratulations! Leaf automatically determines that this is a numeric dataset because the valueQuantity field is populated, and computes statistics for each patient.

Federation is opt-in and requires that two instances be in agreement about their relationship. A single endpoint can be configured in either, or both, of the following states: Responder \u00b6 A Responder endpoint is an instance of Leaf's API that will answer query requests, provided that it has configured your instance as an Interrogator . Interrogator \u00b6 An Interrogator endpoint is an instance of Leaf's API that will be allowed to send query requests to your API instance.

When users navigate to the \u2018Visualize\u2019 or \u2018Patient List\u2019 screens, Leaf performs a JOIN query between the cached patient IDs in the app database and patients in the clinical database to quickly retrieve patient demographics. Thus currently both databases need to be on the same server in order for the JOIN operation to work. I'd like to use an RDBMS besides SQL Server. Does Leaf support any? \u00b6 Answer We understand - there are many great RDBMSs besides SQL Server (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, BigQuery, etc.), and being restricted to SQL Server can be a pain. While Leaf currently only supports SQL Server, we are actively evaluating methods for allowing Leaf to query non-SQL Server databases as well. So if , in a future release we are able to have Leaf work with other RDBMSs, please note that it will likely only be the clinical database (as opposed to the app database), as the work involved in making the clinical database more flexible is much simpler than the app database. (Because the app database has various stored procedures and functions which would need to be written in other SQL dialects, while the clinical database simply executes standard SQL statements). In other words, in the future we may support other clinical database flavors, but you would still need to run the Leaf application database in SQL Server .","title":"Installation Questions"},{"location":"faqs_and_troubleshooting/installation_questions/#installation-questions","text":"","title":"Installation Questions"},{"location":"faqs_and_troubleshooting/installation_questions/#why-do-the-app-and-clinical-databases-need-to-be-on-the-same-server","text":"Answer The reason for this is that after Leaf has executed a \u2018Find Patients\u2019 query, it caches the patient IDs in the app database .

No Leaf server was found \", etc., but the best means of troubleshooting is the same either way. These errors are a symptom of the browser client failing to communicate with the Leaf API. What to do: Check that your API is up-and-running - the Leaf client will only give you vague, indirect information about where the failure lies (note that this is by design and largely for security reasons). There are a number of ways to check if your API is running, including systemctl status or apachectl status (if on Linux), the IIS user interface or Event Viewer (if on Windows), or docker ps -a / podman ps -a (if using containers). Choose the best method appropriate for your deployment. Perhaps most simply, check the Leaf API logs . These will tell you immediately whether the Leaf API successfully started, and/or any errors it has run into along with way. Remember that Leaf API files are stored in the directory you set as your SERILOG_DIR . This can be as simple as: $ tail -10 / $SERILOG_DIR /leaf-api-<todays_date>.log If the API is not running , dig into the logs to see what errors occurred. Often you may find that the API failed to communicate with the Leaf app database (hint: look for \"Error\":\"System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException\" ). These cases are nearly always due to incorrect SQL passwords or usernames configured in your environment variables . If no log files appear and you are running IIS , see I started the Leaf API but don't see any log files! below. Visualization and Patient List error: \"Whoops! An error occurred while loading patient visualizations\" \u00b6 Answer When installing Leaf and running the Leaf client app in your browser, you may run into some variation of this message: These errors result from an error while the API is executing the Basic Demographics query What to do: Check that you've defined a Basic Demographis query - If you haven't yet, go ahead and do so, making sure your output column types match the expected column types. Check the Leaf logs for execution or validation errors - As ensuring de-identification and so on are performed correctly, Leaf is very strict about output column types matching expected column types . The Leaf logs will tell you of any SQL execution errors or column type mismatch errors that occur. I'm trying to build the Leaf client but get the error, \"Failed at...'react-scripts build'\" \u00b6 Answer This is usually caused by older versions of NPM and NodeJS being used. We recommend using NodeJS version 14.9.0+ and NPM version 6.14.8+. You can check your current versions using: $ node --version # v14.9.0 $ npm --version # 6.14.8 If you have an older version, the easiest way to upgrade is typically by using: $ npm upgrade -g See this helpful article or NPM documentation for more information. Alternatively , you could instead also download the latest pre-compiled leaf-ui-client-xxx.tar.gz file from the Leaf Releases page . Leaf API errors \u00b6 I started the Leaf API but don't see any log files! \u00b6 Answer If you are running IIS: Make sure your service account is running in IIS and has permissions to write to the SERILOG_DIR directory. Check the Windows Event Viewer application for possible errors: Check that your browser can communicate with the API - If the API appears to be up, in a separate browser tab, go to https://<your_leaf_url>/api/config . If your browser returns an error with no data: If the error is a 500 , then the API call likely reached the API, but there was an error of some kind. Check the logs to see what went wrong. If the error was a 40x , then the API call likely did not reach the API, in which case your API is not listening or available as you'd expect it to be. In this case, check your Apache or IIS configuration to make sure everything is configured correctly. Note that each of these ( as well as Shibboleth ) include logging of their own which may be helpful. API Error: \"Do not run UNSECURED authentication in non-development environments!\" \u00b6 Answer In a bit of well-intentioned caution, Leaf assumes you will always want to authenticate your users . The reason for this is to prevent inadvertantly allowing access to identified patient information because users weren't authenticated. While that's a precaution, we understand it can also be unhelpful if you're simply evaluating Leaf with synthetic/de-identified data, or only for a small number of users. To do so, as mentioned in the Installation documentation compile the API with: $ dotnet publish -c Debug ...<additional parameters> The -c Debug parameter compiles the Leaf API but relaxes the above requirement. API Error: \"Unable to start Kestrel.\",\"Exception\" : \"System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (13) : Permission denied\" \u00b6 Answer If you are deploying in a Linux environment, be sure the ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable is set: ASPNETCORE_URLS = http://0.0.0.0:5001 API Error: \"Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'path1')\" \u00b6 Answer This occurs if the API is unable to read your environment variables correctly. Check to make sure those are configured and visible to the API. API Error: \"nameID header not found, no scoped identity available\" \u00b6 Answer This error occurs if Shibboleth attributes aren't correctly mapped to user attributes , and thus aren't sent in headers to the Leaf API. Both Apache and IIS use a remote user, which is a special trusted value populated by various mechanisms ( LOGON_USER , REMOTE_USER ) related to the attributes passed along. What to do: Take a look at the Shibboleth logs to see what is being sent in the SAML message (you may need debug mode set) when a user comes back from the login page and then update the attribute-map.xml such that the web server (Service Provider) has those details passed through to the app. If you\u2019re aiming to follow standards, look to InCommon\u2019s Research and Scholarship area where they have expectations of the following: On the releasing side, see https://wiki.refeds.org/display/ENT/Research+and+Scholarship+IdP+Config On the receiving side, in attribute-map.xml : <!-- displayName --> <Attribute name= \"urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:displayName\" id= \"displayName\" /> <Attribute name= \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.241\" id= \"displayName\" /> <!-- email --> <Attribute name= \"urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:mail\" id= \"mail\" /> <Attribute name= \"urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3\" id= \"mail\" />","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"faqs_and_troubleshooting/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"faqs_and_troubleshooting/troubleshooting/#leaf-client-errors","text":"","title":"Leaf client errors"},{"location":"faqs_and_troubleshooting/troubleshooting/#startup-error-contact-your-leaf-administrator","text":"Answer When installing Leaf and running the Leaf client app in your browser, you may run into some variation of this message: The particular message may instead be \" Hmmm...

Info As an alternative to compiling the client code yourself, you may also download the latest pre-built Leaf client from the Leaf Releases page on GitHub . If you download the pre-built version, you can skip ahead to 6 - Configure the appsettings file . Install dependencies $ cd /var/opt/leaf/leaf_download/leaf/ $ cd src/ui-client/ $ npm install Build the client Next we need to build, which transpiles TypeScript and TSX/JSX to JavaScript, minifies the code, and outputs a bundle which we can point Apache or IIS to. To build, execute: $ npm run build This outputs a build bundle to a new src/ui-client/build/ folder. Make sure you are using NodeJS version 14.9.0+ and NPM version 6.14.8+ when building the Leaf client. See the troubleshooting page for more information Deploy build artifacts The final step is to copy the /build folder contents to a directory on the web server that Apache/IIS can serve to users. As we haven't configured Apache or IIS at this point, however, for now just take note of the location of the /build folder. For more information on building and deploying React apps, see the Create React App deployment page . Info In case you're wondering why we're building the Leaf client on the app server (rather than the web server), it's because we've downloaded the Leaf source code on the app server, so for now that's where we'll start.

When the API is run, it begins by reading the appsettings.json file within the compiled API.dll directory to determine how to authenticate users, how to display the Leaf user interface, how to compile SQL statements, and more. In the Leaf source code this file can be found under src/server/API/ relative to the Leaf git repository root directory. As we already compiled the API in Step 4 , though, it can now be found and further customized at the top level of the API.dll directory. On the app server, edit the /var/opt/leafapi/api/appsettings.json file to suit your usage needs based on the parameters described below.

Clin Connection : LEAF_CLIN_DB - Name of the Leaf app database connection string environment variable. DefaultTimeout : Number of seconds allowed before a clinical database query times out. Cohort : QueryStrategy : CTE | PARALLEL - CTE queries wrap individual Leaf panel SQL within a single larger CTE query, and leverage the SQL engine to find the intersect. PARALLEL queries are performed concurrently by the Leaf API, which then map/reduces the results to find the intersect. Given the following example query: Leaf would generate SQL similar to (formatted for readability): In general, we recommend using CTE , though if you are finding that one particularly expensive panel's query slows down or times out the entire CTE query, PARALLEL may be a good option. MaxParallelThreads : Maximum number of allowed concurrent queries to execute if the PARALLEL QueryStrategy . Defaults to 5 if this value is absent. Authentication \u00b6 Mechanism : SAML2 | UNSECURED - Only SAML2 is currently supported for production. Use UNSECURED for development.

We rely on these implementations for integrating Leaf into your environment. Identity Providers (IdP) \u00b6 Conceptually, Leaf does not depend concretely on any specific method of authentication. Instead, it only requires the following structured data be written to the request headers: A scoped identity of the form <identity\\>@<scope\\> A set of entitlements or group memberships in the form of a character delimited list Two well known IdP implementations that we've interacted with are: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Shibboleth Examples \u00b6 UW Shibboleth IdP UW's Shibboleth IdP sends: An eppn attribute with a value of johndoe@washington.edu A gws_groups attribute with a value of urn:mace:washington.edu:groups:uw_leaf_admins; urn:mace:washington.edu:groups:uw_leaf_users , etc. Thus the Leaf appsettings.json configuration is: \"Authentication\" : { \"Mechanism\" : \"SAML2\" , ... \"SAML2\" : { \"Headers\" : { \"ScopedIdentity\" : \"eppn\" } } }, \"Authorization\" : { \"Mechanism\" : \"SAML2\" , \"SAML2\" : { \"HeadersMapping\" : { \"Entitlements\" : { \"Name\" : \"gws_groups\" , \"Delimiter\" : \";\" } }, \"RolesMapping\" : { \"User\" : \"urn:mace:washington.edu:groups:uw_leaf_users\" , \"Super\" : \"NOT_USED\" , \"Identified\" : \"urn:mace:washington.edu:groups:uw_leaf_identified\" , \"Admin\" : \"urn:mace:washington.edu:groups:uw_leaf_admins\" } }, ... UW Medicine ADFS IdP UW Medicine's ADFS IdP sends: A uwUPN attribute with a value of johndoe@amc.uwmedicine.org A uwGroups attribute with a value of am_Leaf_Users; am_Leaf_Identified; am_Leaf_Admin Thus the Leaf appsettings.json configuration is: \"Authentication\" : { \"Mechanism\" : \"SAML2\" , ... \"SAML2\" : { \"Headers\" : { \"ScopedIdentity\" : \"uwUPN\" } } }, \"Authorization\" : { \"Mechanism\" : \"SAML2\" , \"SAML2\" : { \"HeadersMapping\" : { \"Entitlements\" : { \"Name\" : \"uwGroups\" , \"Delimiter\" : \";\" } }, \"RolesMapping\" : { \"User\" : \"am_Leaf_Users\" , \"Super\" : \"NOT_USED\" , \"Identified\" : \"am_Leaf_Identified\" , \"Admin\" : \"am_Leaf_Admin\" } }, ... Service Providers (SP) \u00b6 There are multiple implementations of the Service Provider role in the SAML2 protocol, but as we have only ever used Shibboleth, we will refer to that specifically in the following documentation. Shibboleth SP Installation Media Shibboleth SP Installation Documentation Route Protection Setup \u00b6 There are two routes that must be protected by the SAML2 Service Provider (SP). All other routes are protected by requiring a JWT that can only be generated from a SAML2 SP protected endpoint. / --> React client app /api/user --> Token generation endpoint In a non-federated deployment, you can also elect to protect the entire API surface Warning If you are running Leaf's React application at the root of an IIS Server (e.g. leaf.uwmedicine.org instead of leaf.uwmedicine.org/leaf ), make sure to leave leaf.uwmedicine.org/leafApi unprotected also . Why? Protecting the root of the React client app (e.g., leaf.uwmedicine.org ) in Shibboleth will automatically make all sub-paths protected. If exceptions are only made for requests with the /api path (except for /api/config and /api/user/ , noted above), once the IIS URL Rewrite rule changes the request to the /leafApi path, Shibboleth will intercept this request and not allow the React client app to call the API, thus will breaking the application Web Servers \u00b6 Service Provider considerations for each component: Apache There is no extra Shibboleth Service Provider configuration required to interoperate with Apache. IIS IIS requires a specific ISAPI element within the InProcess element. Additionally, .NET Core does not support server variables and so the IdP provided user attributes must be written to the request headers. A prototypical IIS InProcess element looks like: <InProcess> ...additional configuration <ISAPI normalizeRequest= \"true\" safeHeaderNames= \"true\" useHeaders= \"true\" > <Site id= \"1\" name= \"<server>.<subdomain>.<your_institution>.<tld>\" /> </ISAPI> </InProcess> ADFS Shibboleth Service Provider 3 can be configured to work with ADFS. However, it requires a couple extensions bundled with the installation. The extensions are loaded into the OutOfProcess and InProcess elements via the Extensions element. A prototypical ADFS configuration looks like: <OutOfProcess tranLogFormat= \"%u|%s|%IDP|%i|%ac|%t|%attr|%n|%b|%E|%S|%SS|%L|%UA|%a\" > <Extensions> <Library path= \"adfs.so\" fatal= \"true\" /> </Extensions> </OutOfProcess> ... <InProcess> <Extensions> <Library path= \"adfs-lite.so\" fatal= \"true\" /> </Extensions> ...ISAPI configuration if running in IIS </InProcess> Shibboleth There is no extra Shibboleth Service Provider configuration required to interoperate with a Shibboleth IdP.
